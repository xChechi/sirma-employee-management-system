# OOP Exam – 13.07.2024
## Employee Management System

### Project Overview
This project involves developing a console-based application in Java, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The application will serve as an Employee Management System, enabling users to manage employee data for a company.

### Key Objectives
- Implement OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- Create a user-friendly console interface.
- Ensure data persistence by reading and writing employee data to/from a CSV file.

### Employee Data Management
- **Add Employee:** Input employee details (ID, name, department, role, salary) and add them to the system.
- **Edit Employee:** Modify existing employee details.
- **Fire Employee:** Flag that the employee doesn’t work at the company anymore.
- **List Employees:** Display a list of all active employees with their details.

### Data Persistence
- **Read Data:** Initialize the system with employee data from a CSV file.
- **Write Data:** Save current employee data to a CSV file upon exit.
- **Search Functionality:** Search for employees by name, ID, or department.

### Technical Requirements
- **Classes:** Employee and other relevant classes encapsulating respective properties and methods.
- **Interfaces:** Define interfaces for common functionalities.
- **Abstract Classes:** Use abstract classes where appropriate.

### File Handling
- Implement CSV file operations for data persistence (**DO NOT USE LIBRARIES FOR READING CSV FILES**).

### Exception Handling
- Robust error and exception management for user inputs and file operations.

### Data Structures
- Use appropriate collections (like Lists, Maps) to manage and organize data.

### Documentation
- Comprehensive documentation of classes, methods, and logic flow.
- Source Code: Well-organized and commented Java source files.

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Adherence to OOP principles**
- **Code quality and organization**
- **Functionality and correctness**
- **Error handling and validations**
- **Documentation and ease of use**

Each criterion gives you 20% of total points.
